Provides a simple short code for displaying a list of contributors from any Github repository.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a short code that you can use for showing a photo grid of all users that have contributed code to any Github repository.

You can see this live on the Contributors page for [Easy Digital Downloads](http://easydigitaldownloads.com/contributors/).

Based on the code by [Konstantin Kovshenin](http://kovshenin.com/2012/how-to-get-a-list-of-contributors-from-a-github-project/).
